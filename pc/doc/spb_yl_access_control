Yeah, well, im sitting here witha a RFID reader, and figure spb need a 
gui interface for access control.

So, for the first part i need an easy system for distributing the 
access lists to all the diffrent tag readers, keypads, osv. Maybe i 
will have like three diffrent keypads with tag readers, then i will 
need to be able to control wich tag will open what osv.

So well, now the gui is BETA done, so you can use it to store rfid:s
in main.spbac, and add them to units. Also, you can get the list of
rfid:s on the devices. 

The system works so that you recive all the rfid:s to the main.spbac,
where you can store them with names. When you want to add a key to a 
unit, you simply open the gui(wich loads main.spbac), and add them
from there. 

CURRENTLY Only Type 1 works, only support for rfid only units.

To identify a SPBAC, the config file simply holds lines that says:

SPBAC=true
// 1: RFID
// 2: Keypad
// 3: Keypad & RFID
SPBAC_type=1;		// Type
SPBAC_RFID_MAX=50;	// Max nr off RFID:s
SPBAC_RFIDLEN=3;	// The number of bytes in the RFID string.
