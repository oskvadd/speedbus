Soo, as i was sitting and cewding, i found out that, when the 
DB is flooded with devices, i need somthing to hold this things
apart, so, basicly, now. With each device, lets call the device
:123456
Wee should first off have a tarball, named 
[Device type name]_123456_[Email].tar.gz
With the f-tree
./
./devs/123456.spb
./man/123456.man

Well, thats it, the spb file, you are proboly familiar with the
functions, if not, the info cant be found here. All tho, the 
.man files, i will give you a small introduction. 


Here is the basic 123456.man file:

                      <-  60 chars with ->
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                   Basic on off device                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
| Date: 120810 23:35 | Email: opencline@hotmail.se |______/
+--------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------+
|			   Summary			   |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

Below, it does not matters with ascii-art, but begin with
some basic info like how the on off are bipolar or unipolar.
And if there are timer capabillities, and wat voltage and 
amps the limits are. osv osv. 

+----------------------------------------------------------+
|			Tech data			   |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

This may be a table with recomende voltage, temperature
components included, and so on.

+----------------------------------------------------------+
|			Protocoll			   |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

This is where the funny part begin, here you write down
everything you want to know when you readning this file and
want to know how the device shall be configured. Some 
important knowlegde is, fore example:
* What happends if there are a power disruption, does the 
device need new configurations prefs or does it start up 
by it self. 

It is probobly good to start with somthing like, 
"First time usage". And a example configuration always 
saves time. FAQ and fail search. 

And ofc, there should be a complate summary of the device
specific functions, at protocoll level. Basicly, 
everything you have added under "custom_command_handler".
Also, if the device throws up somting else, like chages
or basicly everything thats got sended sync och async, 
temperatures thats got sent out every 30sec och buttons
that got pushed async...
