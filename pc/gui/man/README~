Soo, as i was sitting and cewding, i found out that, when the 
DB is flooded with devices, i need somthing to hold this things
apart, so, basicly, now. With each device, lets call the device
:123456
Wee should first off have a tarball, named 
[Device type name]_123456_[Email].tar.gz
With the f-tree
./
./devs/123456.spb
./man/123456.man
