Well, because the libconfig does not preserve comment, i think i need
to write down some documentation on the configuration. 

First off, you shall not link the server in a ring. Because that will
result in the servers looping the packages. 

To config a link, just open /etc/spbserver/server.cfg and write in:
links = ( 
  {
    host = "192.168.2.17"; // Server adress
    port = 306;		   // Server port number
    user = "root";	   // Server login username
    pass = "toor";	   // Server login password
  },{
  // Second link
  } );
